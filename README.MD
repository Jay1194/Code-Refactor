# Code-Refactor

## Description
In this project I have refactored starter code, My motivation for this project is to solidfy and showcase my knowledge in Git, Semantic HTML, Web accessibility, and I have made sure all links are functioning correctly. Also, I have reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
